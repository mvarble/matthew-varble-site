This fact has been explored and illustrated for the time-homogeneous case in a recent paper by Duffie, Filipovi{\'{c}} and Schachermayer. However, there are many situations which require time-dependent parameters, such as when it comes to model calibration. This paper provides a rigorous treatment and complete characterization of time-inhomogeneous affine processes.},

The process is constructed as the solution to a system of Poisson driven stochastic differential equations, for which we prove pathwise existence and uniqueness under some reasonable conditions. We next investigate how to approximate a standard N-dimensional Hawkes process by a simple inhomogeneous Poisson process in the meanfield framework where each pair of individuals interact in the same way, in the limit N →∞. In the so-called linear case for the interaction, we further investigate the large time behaviour of the process.We study in particular the stability of the central limit theorem when exchanging the limits N, T →∞ and exhibit different possible behaviours. We finally consider the case G = ℤd with nearest neighbour interactions. In the linear case, we prove some (large time) laws of large numbers and exhibit different behaviours, reminiscent of the infinite setting. Finally, we study the propagation of a single impulsion started at a given point of ℤd at time 0. We compute the probability of extinction of such an impulsion and, in some particular cases, we can accurately describe how it propagates to the whole space.},

abstract = {We revisit wavelet theory starting from the representation of a scaling function as the convolution of a B-spline (the regular part of it) and a distribution (the irregular or residual part). This formulation leads to some new insights on wavelets and makes it possible to rederive the main results of the classical theory - including some new extensions for fractional orders n a self-contained, accessible fashion. In particular, we prove that the B-spline component is entirely responsible for five key wavelet properties: order of approximation, reproduction of polynomials, vanishing moments, multiscale differentiation property, and smoothness (regularity) of the basis functions. We also investigate the interaction of wavelets with differential operators giving explicit time domain formulas for the fractional derivatives of the basis functions. This allows us to specify a corresponding dual wavelet basis and helps us understand why the wavelet transform provides a stable characterization of the derivatives of a signal. Additional results include a new peeling theory of smoothness, leading to the extended notion of wavelet differentiability in the L<sub>p</sub>-sense and a sharper theorem stating that smoothness implies order.},

@article{Abate1992,
abstract = {This paper reviews the Fourier-series method for calculating cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) and probability mass functions (pmf's) by numerically inverting characteristic functions, Laplace transforms and generating functions. Some variants of the Fourier-series method are remarkably easy to use, requiring programs of less than fifty lines. The Fourier-series method can be interpreted as numerically integrating a standard inversion integral by means of the trapezoidal rule. The same formula is obtained by using the Fourier series of an associated periodic function constructed by aliasing; this explains the name of the method. This Fourier analysis applies to the inversion problem because the Fourier coefficients are just values of the transform. The mathematical centerpiece of the Fourier-series method is the Poisson summation formula, which identifies the discretization error associated with the trapezoidal rule and thus helps bound it. The greatest difficulty is approximately calculating the infinite series obtained from the inversion integral. Within this framework, lattice cdf's can be calculated from generating functions by finite sums without truncation. For other cdf's, an appropriate truncation of the infinite series can be determined from the transform based on estimates or bounds. For Laplace transforms, the numerical integration can be made to produce a nearly alternating series, so that the convergence can be accelerated by techniques such as Euler summation. Alternatively, the cdf can be perturbed slightly by convolution smoothing or windowing to produce a truncation error bound independent of the original cdf. Although error bounds can be determined, an effective approach is to use two different methods without elaborate error analysis. For this purpose, we also describe two methods for inverting Laplace transforms based on the Post-Widder inversion formula. The overall procedure is illustrated by several queueing examples.},

The idea is to exploit the cross-entropy method as a tool for choosing good parameters in the importance sampling distribution; in doing so, we use the asymptotic description that given P (Y1+...+Yn > x), n-1 of the Yi have distribution F and one of the conditional distribution of Y given Y > x. We show in some specific parametric examples (Pareto and Weibull) how this leads to precise answers which, as demonstrated numerically, are close to being variance minimal within the parametric class under consideration.

We are mainly concerned with the effect of these perturbations on long time-intervals that increase with the decreasing . We discuss two problems: the first is the behaviour of the invariant measure of the process as , and the second is the distribution of the position of a trajectory at the first time of its exit from a compact domain. An important role is played in these problems by an estimate of the probability for a trajectory of not to deviate from a smooth function by more than during the time . It turns out that the main term of this probability for small and has the form , where is a certain non-negative functional of . A function , the minimum of over the set of all functions connecting and , is involved in the answers to both the problems. By means of we introduce an independent of perturbations relation of equivalence in the phase-space. We show, under certain assumption, at what point of the phase-space the invariant measure concentrates in the limit. In both the problems we approximate the process in question by a certain Markov chain; the answers depend on the behaviour of on graphs that are associated with this chain. Let us remark that the second problem is closely related to the behaviour of the solution of a Dirichlet problem with a small parameter at the highest derivatives.},

@article{Heidelberger1995,
abstract = {This paper surveys efficient techniques for estimating, via simulation, the probabilities of certain rare events in queueing and reliability models. The rare events of interest are long waiting times or buffer overflows in queueing systems, and system failure events in reliability models of highly dependable computing systems. The general approach to speeding up such simulations is to accelerate the occurrence of the rare events by using importance sampling. In importance sampling, the system is simulated using a new set of input probability distributions, and unbiased estimates are recovered by multiplying the simulation output by a likelihood ratio. Our focus is on describing asymptotically optimal importance sampling techniques. Using asymptotically optimal importance sampling, the number of samples required to get accurate estimates grows slowly compared to the rate at which the probability of the rare event approaches zero. In practice, this means that run lengths can be reduced by many orders of magnitude, compared to standard simulation. In certain cases, asymptotically optimal importance sampling results in estimates having bounded relative error. With bounded relative error, only a fixed number of samples are required to get accurate estimates, no matter how rare the event of interest is. The queueing systems studied include simple queues (e.g., GI/GI/1), Jackson networks, discrete time queues with multiple autocorrelated arrival processes that arise in the analysis of Asynchronous Transfer Mode communications switches, and tree structured networks of such switches. Both Markovian and non-Markovian reliability models are treated.},

@article{Sadowsky1991,
abstract = {The problem of using importance sampling to estimate the average time to buffer overflow in a stable GI/GI/m queue is considered. Using the notion of busy cycles, estimation of the expected time to buffer overflow is reduced to the problem of estimating p/sub n/=P (buffer overflow during a cycle) where n is the buffer size. The probability p/sub n/ is a large deviations probability (p/sub n/ vanishes exponentially fast as n to infinity ). A rigorous analysis of the method is presented. It is demonstrated that the exponentially twisted distribution of S. Parekh and J. Walrand (1989) has the following strong asymptotic-optimality property within the nonparametric class of all GI/GI importance sampling simulation distributions. As n to infinity , the computational cost of the optimal twisted distribution of large deviations theory grows less than exponentially fast, and conversely, all other GI/GI simulation distributions incur a computational cost that grows with strictly positive exponential rate.<<ETX>>},

@article{Elliott2000,
abstract = {We first discuss some mathematical tools used to compute the intensity of a single jump process, in its canonical filtration. In the second part, we try to clarify the meaning of default and the links between the default time, the asset's filtration, and the intensity of the default time. We finally discuss some examples.},

@article{Filipovic2009,
abstract = {We revisit affine diffusion processes on general and on the canonical state space in particular. A detailed study of theoretic and applied aspects of this class of Markov processes is given. In particular, we derive admissibility conditions and provide a full proof of existence and uniqueness through stochastic invariance of the canonical state space. Existence of exponential moments and the full range of validity of the affine transform formula are established. This is applied to the pricing of bond and stock options, which is illustrated for the Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Heston models.},
