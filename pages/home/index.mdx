    <h1>Howdy!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Matthew Varble.
      I am a mathematics PhD student at UCSB researching probability theory.
      Broadly speaking, I am interested in stochastic processes and numerical analysis.
      There is just something about combining mathematics and software engineering!
    </p>
    <p>
      This site serves as a blog for me to share things that interest me in both my academic and personal life.
      For instance, you might read about my two brother rats!

  <img src={ matthew } width={ 200 } alt="matthew"/>
</div>

I will also likely want to talk about little math/programming problems I am excited about.
