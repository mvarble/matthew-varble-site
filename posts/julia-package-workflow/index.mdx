import Cite from '../../src/components/cite';

This post serves to briefly explain the <Cite bibKey="julia">Julia</Cite> workflow I have developed which allows me to use my favorite editor <Cite bibKey="vim">Vim</Cite> very interactively with the REPL.
I split this into two sections: one for when I am testing simple scripts and another for larger packages.
This is of course a quick reference for myself, but hopefully it will help other developers out there.

## Scripting

An important thing for me is to be able to develop in the directory of my choosing.
Let's call the following in a shell.

```shell
mkdir ~/dev/my-new-script-directory
cd ~/dev/my-new-script-directory
```

From here, I declare a local environment and immediately add <Cite bibKey="revise-jl">Revise.jl</Cite>.

```shell
julia
]activate .
add Revise
```

In another shell in this same directory, I then open Vim at some file `index.jl`.
Here, I write whatever scripts I please and be sure to add the necessary packages to my activated environment.
As I write new functions within my script, I interact with them in the REPL by using the `Revise.includet(::String)` method.
For instance, back in the Julia REPL (being sure to backspace to migrate from `pkg>` to `juila>`),

```julia
using Revise
includet("index.jl")
```

will expose the namespace of `index.jl` and dynamically update with new writes to the file.

## Packaging

When developing a package, I effectively do the same thing.
Suppose I already have some package.

```
~/dev/SomePackage.jl/
├── Manifest.toml
├── Project.toml
├── src
│   └── SomePackage.jl
│   └── ...
└── test
    └── runtests.jl
    └── ...
```

With a shell in the project directory, I create a new directory `sandbox` and activate a new Julia environment with Revise and the parent package in development mode.

```shell
mkdir sandbox
cd sandbox
julia
]activate .
add Revise
dev ../
```

As before, with a shell in this `sandbox` directory, I may use Vim to edit some file `index.jl` and interactively have access to the namespace in the REPL.

```julia
using Revise
using SomePackage
includet("index.jl")
```


More importantly, because I told Pkg to develop `SomePackage.jl` relatively when running `dev ../`, I may also edit the source files of `SomePackage` in the parent directory and ensure changes propogate to the REPL.

On separate development sessions, the `sandbox` environment will still have `SomePackage.jl` in the Manifest, so all we must do is be sure to include Revise.
In other words, each time I return back to developing, I go to the `~/dev/SomePackage.jl/sandbox` directory in a shell and run the following,

```shell
julia
]activate .
```

type a backspace to move from `pkg>` to `julia>`, and import accordingly.

```julia
using Revise
using SomePackage
```
